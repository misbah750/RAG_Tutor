# RAG_Tutor
RAG PDF Chatbot built with Streamlit, LangChain, and Chroma. Upload a PDF and ask questions answered strictly from the document, with deduplicated source citations showing page and section. Uses local Ollama models by default (llama3.2 for chat, mxbai-embed-large for embeddings) with optional OpenAI support. Modern dark UI, caching for speed.
